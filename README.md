# RMS Support Tool -> Unified Labeling Support Tool -><br>Compliance Utility

> **Note**
> 
> The 'RMS_Support_Tool' has been retired and replaced by the [Unified Labeling Support Tool](https://github.com/microsoft/UnifiedLabelingSupportTool). The Unified Labeling Support Tool became a [Microsoft Open Source](https://opensource.microsoft.com) project and moved to the [Microsoft organization repository]( https://aka.ms/UnifiedLabelingSupportTool). The 'Unified Labeling Support Tool' grew over time to manage not only sensitivity labels and policies (Unified Labeling), but also DLP, sensitive information types, data classifications and more. Today, all under the hood of the Microsoft Purview Compliance Portal. This gave rise to the idea of reflecting the extended range of functions in the name of the tool, and so the new name [Compliance Utility](https://github.com/microsoft/ComplianceUtility/tree/main) was born.
